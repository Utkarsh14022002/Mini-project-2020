### Area: ```Circuit Synthesis, Web Application```
### Title: 
Circuit Synthesis as a Web Application – Web Application for synthesizing Implementation of Synchronous Sequential Circuit from its State Transition Diagram.

### Objective: 
>To design and Implement a Web-based platform using which the user can draw the state transition diagram of a synchronous sequential circuit and derive its implementation (in terms of flip-flops of desired types and logic gates)

**Background Study:** Digital Logic (Synchronous Sequential Circuit Design), Web Application Development (HTML, Javascript, PHP, XML)



### Subtasks to start with:
**Common For Everyone**
1. Make Apache web-server (with PHP support) work at your laptop/desktop computer (By
default it should be working at Linux stations). (Time to spend: 1 hour)
2. Write (and/or collect from the Internet) simple html, CSS, javacscript, PHP codes and
see that your browser + web server working as desired.
3. Collect Reference Study Materials for HTML, CSS, Javacsript, PHP, (Time to spend: 2
hours)
4. To learn how to design synchronous sequential circuits (4 hours) (It is a part of the
Digital Logic Course offered at 3 rd Semester)


**To be distributed among the team members**
1. Draw a point (a circle with a small radius) in the web-browser wherever (in the browser)
the left mouse button is clicked.
2. Draw connected straight lines (polylines) in the web-browser – There will be a sequence
of clicks of the left mouse button, where the 1 st click will draw a point (a circle with a
small radius) and subsequent clicks will draw a point as well as a straight line
connecting the present point and the previous point. A click of the middle mouse button
ends the process.
3. Draw a circle with a fixed radius in the web-browser wherever (in the browser) the left
mouse button is clicked.
4. Let a number a number of `circles’ be stored (in terms of their centers’ co-ordinates and
radii) as an XML document in a file. Write a PHP program that reads such a file and
draws the circles in the browser.
5. “Spline is a flexible strip used to produce a smooth curve through a designated
set of points”. Choose some spline algorithm and draw a spline in the web-
browser through the points marked by the clicks of the left mouse-button.
